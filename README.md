#Swift 3 Protocol-Oriented Programming - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Swift 3 Protocol-Oriented Programming - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/swift-3-protocol-oriented-programming-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787129948), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
One of the most important additions to the new features and capabilities of the Swift programming language was an overhaul of Protocols. Protocol-oriented programming and first class value semantics have now become two incredibly powerful concepts at the heart of Swiftâ€™s design.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```

enum TerrainType {
case Land
case Sea
case Air
}
```

To follow along with the examples in this book, the reader will need to have an Apple
computer with OS X 10.12 or higher installed. They will also need to install Xcode version
8.0 or higher with Swift version 3 or higher. At least a basic knowledge of the Swift
programming language is required.
